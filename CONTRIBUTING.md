## Development Guide

### Quick start

#### Download CEF from [cef-builds](https://cef-builds.spotifycdn.com/index.html)

```sh
cd sys
./upgrade.rs aarch64-apple-darwin --download
```

#### Build

```sh
cargo build
```

### Architecture

Like many FFI crates, there are two crates in this repo: `cef-rs` in root and `cef-sys` in sys directory. `cef-sys` contains C APIs generated by `sys/upgrade.rs`. You shouldn't edit the code directly in this crate. `cef-rs` is where type safe bindings land. Most features and implementation should go here.

### Upgrade CEF bindings

#### [Install clang](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen/blob/main/book/src/requirements.md#clang)

#### Install bindgen

```sh
cargo install bindgen-cli
```

#### Download CEF

```sh
cd sys

./upgrade.rs x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --download
```
This command will download and extract prebuilt CEF from [cef-builds](https://cef-builds.spotifycdn.com/index.html) into `sys/cef/archive` as specified by `[env.CEF_PATH]` in `.cargo/config.toml`.

#### Bindgen

```sh
cd sys
./upgrade.rs x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --bindgen
```
This command will generate bindings into `sys/bindings/<target>` with `bindgen`.
